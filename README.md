#Case Study

A simple Template for publishing writings of editorial content concerning the fields of humanities, art and History.

The origin of this template arises from the will of the french critic and editor Mnsr. Alain Moreau, who signs as Bansky Dellarte.

His project conveys to get, effectively, a diffusion of his writings through the social network Blogger. As the content is mean to be published and focused on the academic and literate reader, we primacy the appearance and concept of "the book as an object".

We wanted to mimic the structure of a classic newspaper written column. To reach this goal, it has been carefully selected the fonts in use, the range of colours, and the spaces and characters between paragraphs; allowing the intended audience to a pleasant reading focused on content, with the use and interaction of a measured scroll interaction, and without distractions.

The one-column concept creates a share of spaces permitting us to tailor and position both text and images for the perfect fit into different screen formats or devices.

No comments allowed, and minimum widgets included by default.

We guess you might find of use, if you like to write and publish for the Web.

Made in 2015 with the technology of Blogger.
