#Case Study

Template for publishing writings of editorial content concerning the fields of humanities, art and History. It arises from the need of the editor Mnsr. Alain Moreau, who signs as Bansky Dellarte. 

The projecte conveys to get, effectively, a diffusion of his writings through the social network Blogger.As the content to be published is focused on the academic and literate reader, we primacy the  appearance and concept of the book "as an object".

We wanted to mimic the structure of a classic newspaper written column. To this end, it has been carefully selected the fonts in use, the range of colours, and the spaces and characters between paragraphs; allowing the audience a pleasant reading focused on content, with a measured scroll interaction and without distractions.

The one-column concept leaves a division of spaces permit us to tailor and position text and images for different screen formats or devices.

No comments allowed, and minimun widgets included by default.
