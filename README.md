#What is it

Template for publishing writings of editorial content concerning the humanities, art and historical field. It arises from the need of an editor, Mr. Alain Moreau, which conveys to get, effectively, a diffusion of his writings through the social network Blogger.

As its literary content is focused on the academic and literate reader, we primacy appearance and concept of thebook "as object".

We wanted to mimic the structure of the classic newspaper columns. To this end, it has been carefully selectedl the fonts to use, the range of colors, and the spaces; all of which allow us a pleasant reading without distractions.

The one-column concept leaves a division of spaces that allow us to tailor content for different screen formats.

No comments allowed, by default.
