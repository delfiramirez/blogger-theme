#Case Study

A simple Template for publishing writings of editorial content concerning the fields of humanities, art and History.

The origin of this template arises from the will of the french critic and editor M. Alain Moreau, who signs as Bansky Dellarte.

His project conveys to get in an effective manner a diffusion of his writings as a pamphlet through the social network Blogger. As the content is meant to be published and is focused on the academic and the literate reader, we took primacy over the appearance and concept of "the book as an object".

We wanted to mimic the structure of a classic newspaper written column. To reach this goal, we carefully selected the fonts in use, the range of colours, and the spaces and characters between paragraphs; allowing to the intended audience  a pleasant reading, focused on content, with the use and interaction of a measured scroll interaction, and without distractions.

The one-column concept creates a share of spaces permitting us to tailor and position both text and images for the perfect fit into different screen formats or devices.

No comments allowed, and minimum widgets are included by default.

We guess you might find it of use, if you like to write and publish for the Web.

Made in 2015 with the technology of Blogger.
