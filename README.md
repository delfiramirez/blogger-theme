#What is it

Template for publishing writings of editorial content concerning the humanities, art and historical field. It arises from the need of an editor, Mr. Alain Moreau, which conveys to get, effectively, a diffusion of his writings through the social network Blogger.

As the content to be published is focused on the academic and literate reader, we primacy the  appearance and concept of the book "as an object".

We wanted to mimic the structure of a classic newspaper column. To this end, it has been carefully selected the fonts to use, the range of colors, and the spaces between paragraphs; allowing us a pleasant reading without distractions.

The one-column concept leaves a division of spaces permit us  to tailor the content for different screen formats or devices.

No comments allowed, by default.
